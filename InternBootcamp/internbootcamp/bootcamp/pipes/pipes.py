### 谜题描述

The \"Pipes\" puzzle is a grid-based logic game where players connect colored endpoints with continuous, non-overlapping paths under the following rules:

1. **Grid Structure**: The puzzle is played on a rectangular grid. Each cell can either be empty, contain a pipe segment, or hold a colored endpoint.

2. **Endpoints**: 
   - Each color appears exactly twice on the grid, acting as an input (start) and output (end). 
   - All endpoints are pre-placed, and the goal is to connect matching colors.

3. **Pipe Path Rules**:
   - Paths must connect pairs of the same color, filling all cells between them.
   - Pipes can only run horizontally or vertically (no diagonal moves).
   - Paths must be continuous and cannot branch, cross other paths, or overlap. Each cell belongs to at most one pipe.

4. **Grid Completion**:
   - Every cell in the grid must be occupied by either a pipe segment or an endpoint. No empty cells are allowed in the solved state.

5. **Validity**:
   - A valid solution ensures all colored pairs are connected, and the entire grid is filled without rule violations.
