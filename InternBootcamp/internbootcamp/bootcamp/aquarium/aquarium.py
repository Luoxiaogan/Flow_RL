### 谜题描述

The Aquarium puzzle is solved by determining water levels for each aquarium region in a grid, adhering to the following rules:

1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is divided into contiguous regions (aquariums) by thick borders. Each cell belongs to exactly one aquarium.

2. **Water Levels**: Each aquarium must be filled with water up to a consistent horizontal level. This level is a specific row number chosen such that:
   - Every column within the aquarium contains cells up to at least this row (i.e., the level cannot exceed the shortest column height in the aquarium).
   - All cells in the aquarium’s columns from the bottom row up to the chosen level are filled. Cells above this level in the aquarium remain empty.

3. **Row and Column Clues**: 
   - Numbers on the right side of each row indicate the total number of filled cells required in that row across all aquariums.
   - Numbers at the bottom/top of each column indicate the total number of filled cells required in that column across all aquariums.

4. **Objective**: Fill cells to satisfy all row/column numerical clues while ensuring each aquarium’s water level is uniformly applied to its columns.

- The grid has {rows} rows and {cols} columns.

- Aquarium regions are as follows (each number represents the aquarium ID for that cell):
{regions_table}

- Each row has a clue on the right indicating the total filled cells in that row. The row clues are: {row_clues}.

- Each column has a clue at the bottom indicating the total filled cells in that column. The column clues are: {col_clues}.

Your task is to determine the water level for each aquarium. The water level is the highest row number filled (0-based from the bottom). Each aquarium's water level must be such that all its columns are filled up to this level.

Provide your answer as a list of integers in column order (from left to right), where each integer is the water level for the corresponding column's aquarium. Enclose your answer within [answer] and [/answer]. For example, if the solution is levels 2, 1, 0 for columns 0, 1, 2, write:
[answer]2 1 0[/answer]"""
